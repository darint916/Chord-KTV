## 💡 Contribution Guidelines

1. Follow the existing folder structure when adding new files.
2. Keep controllers focused on request handling, moving logic to services.
3. Use DTOs for API responses to separate models from exposed data.
4. Always test your changes before making a pull request.

## PostgreSQL setup:

Make sure you have the PostgreSQL Docker image pulled, and that Docker Desktop is running.

Before building, run this command:
```bash
docker run -d -e POSTGRES_USER=<uname-for-postgres> -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<pwd-for-postgres> -p <free-port-number>:5432 postgres:15.4
```
This will start up a local containerized instance of PostgreSQL.

Create a secrets.json file with these contents:
```
{
    "ConnectionStrings:PostgreSql": "Host=localhost;Port=<port-no-for-postgres>;Database=postgres;Username=<uname-for-postgres>;Password=<pwd-for-postgres>"
}
```

After building, if you see an error like this:
```
fail: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command[20102]
      Failed executing DbCommand (17ms) [Parameters=[], CommandType='Text', CommandTimeout='5']
      SELECT "MigrationId", "ProductVersion"
      FROM "__EFMigrationsHistory"
      ORDER BY "MigrationId";
```
It's likely due to an issue with .NET EF core, this can be resolved by running
```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

This should allow you to build the project successfully using ```dotnet run```.
